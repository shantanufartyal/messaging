# Messaging

This project was generated with MEAN(Mongo, Express, Angular and Nodejs) stack.
With Angular I'm Devextreme in the front-end.

## Overview

This is a messaging web app created using MEAN stack.

Currently It doesn't store the message in db, It just bradcast the message to all users. To bradcast the message I'm using socker.io.

The UI is inspired by Whatsapp.
